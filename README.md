# E-Commerce Environmental Impact Dashboard

## Project Overview

This interactive dashboard visualizes the environmental impact of e-commerce through sophisticated data visualizations and engaging UI components. The dashboard features a modular, component-based architecture with extensive interactivity to engage users with the content.

## Core Features

- Interactive data visualizations showing e-commerce environmental impacts
- Responsive design working across all device sizes
- Light/dark theme support
- Animated timeline of environmental impacts
- Interactive growth projections with adjustable parameters
- Material degradation visualization

## Directory Structure

- `/css`: Stylesheet files organized by component and utility
- `/js`: JavaScript modules for components and visualizations
- `/assets`: Images, fonts, and other static assets
- `/data`: JSON data files powering the visualizations
- `/docs`: Project documentation

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. Explore the interactive dashboard

## Data Sources

The visualizations are based on data compiled from:
- Industry reports (Pitney Bowes, Statista)
- Academic and government studies (OECD, EPA, IPCC)
- Company sustainability disclosures (Amazon, Oceana)
- Research organizations

## Technologies Used

- D3.js for data visualizations
- Vanilla JavaScript (no framework dependencies)
- CSS with custom properties for theming
- Intersection Observer API for scroll animations

## Future Development

Planned enhancements include:
- Additional visualization types
- More granular regional data
- User-adjustable parameters for impact calculations
- Printable report generation
